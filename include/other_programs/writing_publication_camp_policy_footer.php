    <span class="text">‘This initiative aims to support faculty and graduate students in developing and publishing high-quality research. It begins with a structured program for faculty members, guiding them through the research and publication process. The program starts with sessions covering manuscript development, literature review, and journal selection, followed workshops focused on revision, editing, and navigating the publication process.
    <br><br> Alongside this, a training component will equip selected faculty members to facilitate future writing support programs. This includes training in program promotion, peer learning facilitation, feedback provision, and documentation. Representatives from various campuses will also participate, fostering a collaborative writing culture.
    <br><br>Graduate students will also benefit through a structured mentorship initiative, where participants will engage in writing groups. These sessions will help refine their research, improve academic writing skills, and prepare their work for publication.
    <br><br>The program will culminate in a presentation day, where faculty members will share their research findings with the university community. Institutional leaders will also discuss ways to sustain a long-term writing support culture. A final report will be provided to leadership, ensuring continued collaboration and growth.
    <br><br> <strong>Join us at the UNESCO Academic Writing and Publication Camp in Istanbul.</strong>’
